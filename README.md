# CSV-files
I downloaded data from https://ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/ and https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/. My data is in the form of JSON and CSV.
I used Matplotlib and Plotly packages to visualize data.
For example, I used data to display variations in temperature in two dissimilar environments: Sitka, Alaska, and Death Valley,California.  
I also created visualizations that show the global distribution of earthquakes based on their magnitudes.
